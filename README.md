## üéπ Features (v1.1)

* A fully interactive, multi-octave piano keyboard GUI.
* Visual feedback for both white keys (themed `ttk` widgets) and black keys (classic `tk` widgets).
* Event handling for each key press, which prints the corresponding note to the console.
* Clean, well-documented, and modular code structure with a professional entry point.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Python 3:** The core programming language.
* **Tkinter / ttk:** For building the graphical user interface.
* **Git & GitHub:** For version control.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### UnicodeEncodeError on Windows

On some Windows systems, the default terminal cannot display special Unicode characters (like the `‚ô≠` symbol) and may crash with a `UnicodeEncodeError`. If you encounter this, here are two solutions:

1.  **Run from the Command Line with the UTF-8 flag:**
    Execute the script using this command instead of the standard one:
    ```bash
    python -X utf8 mini_synth_v1.1.py
    ```

2.  **Configure VS Code's Runner (`launch.json`):**
    If you are running the file using the VS Code "Run" button, you can create a `.vscode/launch.json` file in your project with the following content to automatically enable UTF-8 mode for every run:
    ```json
    {
        "version": "0.2.0",
        "configurations": [
            {
                "name": "Python: Current File",
                "type": "python",
                "request": "launch",
                "program": "${file}",
                "console": "integratedTerminal",
                "justMyCode": true,
                "env": {
                    "PYTHONUTF8": "1"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
